# Welcome to Serverless!
#
# This file is the main config file for your service.
# It's very minimal at this point and uses default values.
# You can always add more config options for more control.
# We've included some commented out config examples here.
# Just uncomment any of them to get that config option.
#
# For full config options, check the docs:
#    v1.docs.serverless.com
#
# Happy Coding!

#   NOTE: I decided not to use this feature, since Serverless doesn't support 
#           sending a constant JSON value to the Lambda function, which is a feature
#           in CloudWatch Events.
#   
#   you can add any of the following events
#   events:
#     - http:
#         path: users/create
